# Instacart_data_analysis
Analysis of Instacart data sample to identify sales pattern and trend using Python on jupyter notebook.

## Introduction
 Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app in North America. They have made their data available online for the purpose of learning. However, the contents of this project have been fabricated and does not include any PII.
 
## Objective
Althought Instacart already has very good sales volumn, but their goal is to uncover more information about their sales patterns. They would like to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age?
Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

● What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are
ordering, and anything else you can think of.
